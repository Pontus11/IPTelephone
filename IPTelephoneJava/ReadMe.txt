Simple ip telephone with a server. Functions as a simplified version of Skype or similar software. The users can 
add friends, send chat messages, change their profile pictures, make phone calls and receive phone calls. 

Main class for the ip telephone client is PhoneGuiFX.java
Main class for the server is IPTServer.java

The server uses SQLite as an embedded database and can do everthing ranging from creating a new user, handle loggins, handeling chat histories, add friends and more. 

The project was created as part of a solo university project with a very short deadline of only a few days.
